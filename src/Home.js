            introduction: `I fell in love with technology after the entrance of the
                          iPhone in 2007. I had already had a general interest with tech prior
                          to the iPhoneâ€™s release but after witnessing what could be done with
                          technology and software, I was hooked! That led me to work at companies like
                          AT&T and Mosaic to quench my thirst for all things
                          tech. That passion eventually lead me on a journey to learn
                          how to code. I now feel confident enough to take my skills
                          to the next level and I'm now also looking to build
                          robust applications with a fast-paced and growing company.`,
            currently: `I am currently attending SMU's Full Stack Flex Web Development bootcamp
                   which is a 6 month program aimed at preparing students to be front-end and
                   back-end developers. I am also a recipient of "Grow with Goole Challenge"
                   Scholarship which means that I get to interact with people all over the world
                   to participate in global learning environment. My goal is to code as much as I
                   possible can until Im in a position to do some good.`
