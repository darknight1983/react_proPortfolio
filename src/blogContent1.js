          In this post, I want to share my experience with the SMU Coding Bootcamp. I want to reflect on the things that were most notable to me through this experience. I am not a seasoned blogger so forgive me if my thoughts wonder all over the place in this post. To start, I want you guys to know that I enjoyed going through this bootcamp. The main reason is that I know that my understanding of basic web development fundamentals went to the next level. I actually feel like a web developer who is confident in the skills that I have and that is a great feeling. Before I go any further,
          Iâ€™d like to share the best thing about this experience. For me, it was observing the other people in my cohort. Not just watching people, but more like watching and being present while people were going through the bootcamp themselves. It is something about witnessing other people being creative that I really enjoy. Maybe it
          is the eagerness in the faces of people when great ideas are being pondered upon. Its
          just something about the creative process that I find very attractive I guess. Another thing about this experience was the many technologies that were covered up to this point. Ill point out that we still have a little over a month and two weeks left in the program. We covered a lot of technologies in this bootcamp. I think I had to start writing down the different tools that we used just to keep track. That was awesome because it really speaks to the fact that there are so many ways to do whatever it is you want to do and so many tools to help you get it done. The last thing I like to share with anyone reading is that if you decide to take this journey, just know that you can do it. I say that because I just think back to where I started from and I am honestly proud of the progress that I made. The fact that I can learn a technology on my own is electrifying and really rewarding for me and I bet someone out there who went down this path feels the same way.
