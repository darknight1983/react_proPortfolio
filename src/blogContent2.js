        This post is for the people who want to learn how to code. I feel like it is partly my responsibility to share as much as I possibly can with those in and out of the community and I will do so in the best way that I can. So again, this one is for those folks out there who are considering programming as a career. Get ready to work your ass off! Yep, I said it! Ill say it again too! “Get ready to work your ass off !!”. Programming is not easy and there is no reason for me to make it seem like it is. Learning how to code is going to take real effort if you plan on making a career or plan on building something sophisticated on your own. This has been one of the challenging experiences that I have every had and honestly I don’t know if I would have made it as far as I have if I didn’t start at the exact time that I did. Let me explain that last statement for more clarity. If I would have tried to learn how to code in my mid to late twenties, I honestly feel like I would have not been successful. Before you read that as a negative comment, understand were I am coming from. At that time, I did not have the patience and that is the one thing that you must have in order to be successful in this journey. There are going to be many times that you find yourself frustrated “af”. Most people reading this will know what the “af” means. Your going to have to learn to be okay with the process of learning which is
        different for people individually and that is okay. If you have the grit to stick with it particularly when your struggling, I think you have what it takes to do this. Make sure you find a mentor to help you through the struggles. That will save you billions of hours of time going in circles. Find you some people that you like to work with also. People will help to keep you motivated through those hard times.  Also make sure that you have other things going in life outside of programming. Go surfing, hiking, skydiving, or whatever it is that floats your boat. Just make sure you have something else that you like to do and spend time doing that other thing from time to time. When you get the chance to share things that helped you, pass them on. People could always use some motivation.
